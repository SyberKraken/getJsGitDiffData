Project data-parsing and generation is ran with a rust-script in folder as well as a nodejs-express server.

To start server: node server.js
Generate new data via "http://localhost:5500/generation" page where you can run the rust-generation scripts that generate pre-named datafiles that the visualization shows.

Or you can manualy generate a variety of files via the rust script:

Compile rust script with: cargo biuld --release
Rust-functionality:
run: target/release/gitdiff.json.exe
    1st arg chooses mode:
        "repo":
            example run command:  target/release/gitdiff.json.exe "repo" "C:\Downloads\gitrepo\"
            args(in order): "directory_path"
            this mode can run on a folder wich contains a git-repo.
            it generates a jsonfile called "generatedJson.json" wich contains all commits performed in a git repository with minimaly required data to perform the rest of operations in the program.

        "multi_analysis":
            example run command:  target/release/gitdiff.json.exe "multi_analysis" "existingFile.json" "new_analysis"
            args(in order): "json_data_path", "new_file_name", ["print_logs"]
            this mode runs analysis of all factors in the file on specified "json_data_path" wich needs to be a file generated by the
            "repo" command. It will create a file containing all factors ranked and their relative performance in terms of how many
            precentage points better they are at detecting bugs in the specified repositort. If the "print_logs" arg exists it will
            also print a log-file with all the runs performed and the exact result of all runs for all factors for the specified
            repository.

        "d3"
            example run command: target/release/gitdiffjson.exe "d3" "existingJson.json" "full" "files" "23" "100"
            arg(in order): "existing Json File" "new filename" "files" "factor(number)" "cuttof(number)"
            This mode runs on data generated form the "repo" mode.
            This mode generate the "containers" folder wich contains the entire filestructure of the generated data from
            "existing Json File", it also generates a singular file with name "filename_d3.json" with the arg filename wich contains
            the top nr of files in the repo.
            the "files" arg chooses to ignore function-treemap generation
            (!!!!!!!!OBS!!!!!this is the only functional parameter in this arg currentley as function-treemap generation is not functional.)
            the "factor" arg is a number and chooses what factor is used to generage both the container folder and singular file.
            the "cuttof" arg chooses how many file items to display in the singular file generated.
            The visualization uses the name "full" for its generation, but you can manualy enter a file as a get-parameter in the
            search bar if you want to generate multiple different ones and not have to overwrite it every time you switch between
            them since the express server serves all files in the folder

        There are some more "modes" in teh code but they are more for testing or running partial parts of the code or debugging.
